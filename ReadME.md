## Introduction

For this project, we will be building a time series forecasting model in python to predict monthly sales for a retail company.
Our project will see us clean and preprocess historical sales data, and apply ARIMA and exponential
smoothing techniques. Our objective is to achieve a prediction accuracy of approx. 90% and provide recommendations.
